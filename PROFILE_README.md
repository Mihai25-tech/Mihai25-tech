### Hi, I'm Mike

Junior Data Analyst | London | SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel

## About Me

I analyze data to find actual business problems, not what people think the problem is.

Recently worked with Ukrainian coffee startup. Owner wanted to spend more on marketing. Data showed 69% of customers never came back after first purchase - completely different problem to solve.

Background: 6 years Marine Engineer → Data Analyst. Turns out tracking engine KPIs and analyzing business metrics use the same skills.

## Featured Project

**Coffee E-Commerce Analytics** - 6 months of wartime analysis
- Found why revenue dropped 47% (retention problem, not marketing)
- 1,685 customers, 4.67M UAH, 69% churn rate
- SQL cohort analysis + Python + Tableau dashboards + Excel modeling
